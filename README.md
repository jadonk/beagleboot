BeagleBone USB bootloader as a Google Chrome app

Based on the [BBBlfs](https://github.com/ungureanuvladvictor/BBBlfs)
work of Vlad V. Ungureanu <ungureanuvladvictor@gmail.com> done as a 
[Google Summer of Code project](http://beagleboard.org/gsoc)

Before this can be developed, host operating systems will need to
release the device from underneath other driver control. This is
currently [under discussion for ChromeOS](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/chromium-os-dev/c7JDZG-T_gc/TXgiVZqjs0EJ)
